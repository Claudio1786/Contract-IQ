## Core User Personas

| Persona | Context | Goals | Pain Points | "Wow" Moments |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Morgan – Procurement Lead** | Owns $20M SaaS vendor spend with lean legal support | Stop renewal surprises, negotiate from strength, keep budgets predictable | Hidden auto-renewals, manual clause comparisons, poor pricing intelligence | Benchmark shows price 23% above peers → instant counter strategy with sourced citations |
| **Priya – Legal Ops Manager** | Coordinates intake and review for fast-moving SaaS deals | Standardize clause review, maintain defensible audit trail, reduce backlog | Generic CLM lacks SaaS-specific risk scoring, obligations tracked in spreadsheets | AI flags CPI escalation + suggests fallback language sourced to contract |
| **Jamal – NIL Collective Director** | Manages 75 athletes, compliance and donor pressure | Prevent eligibility issues, avoid conflicts, prove program value | Constantly changing NCAA/state rules, no portfolio view, staff turnover | Portfolio dashboard highlights exclusivity clash before signing a new deal |
| **Elena – Sports Agent** | Represents 25 athletes, handles negotiations solo or with small staff | Win better terms, protect clients, scale workload | Benchmark data scattered, manual compliance checks, little leverage data | Deal comparison reveals brand offer is 40% below peers → negotiation playbook generated in seconds |
| **Lena – Brand Partnerships Lead** | Evaluates NIL proposals alongside legal/compliance | Ensure brand safety, ROI, and compliance alignment | Hard to vet conflicts and unusual terms quickly, slow legal cycles | Intake summary surfaces high-risk clauses with recommended adjustments before it reaches counsel |

### Persona Implications
- **Pricing & Packaging:** Personas map to tiers (Athlete Pro, Collective, Procurement Team, Enterprise).
- **Onboarding:** Tailor welcome screens to data source (vendor spend imports vs. athlete contracts).
- **Feature Depth:** Prioritize benchmarks and conflict detection that unlock the "wow" moments above.
- **Success Metrics:** Track time-to-first-insight, renewal savings, compliance incidents prevented per persona.
