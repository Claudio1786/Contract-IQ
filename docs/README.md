## Contract IQ Product Documentation

This directory contains the foundational product materials that inform the Contract IQ build.

- `product-roadmap.md` – phased plan covering the first twelve months of delivery.
- `user-personas.md` – primary personas, goals, pain points, and the moments that unlock value.
- `mvp-spec.md` – scope of the initial product release including in-scope/out-of-scope features.
- `rule-benchmarks.md` – high-value rule libraries and benchmark dimensions per vertical.
- `data-incentives.md` – incentive loops designed to compound the dataset.
- `analytics-instrumentation.md` – telemetry required to measure product health from day one.
- `prototype-plan.md` – execution steps for getting from design sprint to pilot-ready release.

> These docs live on a dedicated branch (`docs/product-foundation`) to preserve a clean main branch for product code.
