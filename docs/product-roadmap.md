## Product Roadmap (0–12 Months)

### Phase 0 — Foundation (Weeks 0–2)
- Confirm vertical focus via founder-market fit scorecard and live pipeline validation.
- Form legal entity, banking, data privacy policies, and SOC 2 readiness plan.
- Launch manual contract-audit pilot (≥5 active prospects) to seed the dataset and message.

### Phase 1 — Core Intelligence MVP (Weeks 3–8)
- Build ingestion pipeline: file upload/connectors → OCR → LLM extraction → schema mapping → confidence scoring.
- Stand up Postgres + `pgvector` with multi-tenant guards, version history, and manual review queue.
- Ship critical UI flows: onboarding wizard, processing dashboard, contract detail with insight cards and citations.

### Phase 2 — Portfolio Intelligence & Collaboration (Weeks 9–16)
- Release portfolio command center (renewal waterfall, conflict heatmap, KPI cards).
- Add multi-user collaboration (comments, tasks, audit log) and exportable negotiation playbooks.
- Deliver vertical-specific rule engines (SaaS auto-renewal/liability; Sports compliance/conflict detection).

### Phase 3 — Growth & Defensibility (Months 5–8)
- Launch data contribution incentives and referral loops to enrich benchmarks.
- Expand benchmark coverage to ≥70% of target clause categories; monitor accuracy nightly.
- Harden security posture (encryption policies, role-based access, zero-retention controls) toward SOC 2 Type II.

### Phase 4 — Scale & GTM Acceleration (Months 9–12)
- Instrument product analytics (activation funnels, retention, ROI impact) and build internal dashboards.
- Ship integrations: Slack/email alerts, export APIs, and CLM/ERP connectors for target personas.
- Prepare fundraising materials (metrics narrative, customer case studies, data moat proof) for pre-seed/seed.
